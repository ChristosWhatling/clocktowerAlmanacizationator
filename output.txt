\subsubsection{Summary}
Legion is many Demons.
\begin{itemize}
\item The recommended number of good and evil players is the reverse of the normal. For example, for a ten player game, there are roughly seven Legion and three good players.
\item The players that are not Legion may be Townsfolk or Outsiders, in any combination.
\item If at least one good player voted for the nomination, and that player is “about to die”, then the execution happens as normal. If only evil players vote for a nomination, the vote tally for that nominee is zero.
\item Each Legion registers as a Minion as well as a Demon.
\item The Storyteller chooses which player dies at night.
\item If only one good player remains alive, the Storyteller may declare that evil wins, since good cannot win.
\item The Storyteller can decide not to give Legion players bluffs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How to Run}
\begin{itemize}
\item During the first night, during the Demon Info step, let all Legion players make eye contact. (You may want to point to the non-Legion players so that Legion knows who they are.)
\item Each night except the first, you may decide that a player dies.
\item When counting votes, count out loud, as normal. If the vote tally is enough to make a player about to die but only evil players voted, declare that the vote tally is zero.
\item Most nights, kill a Legion. Killing a good player is usually unfair. Your aim is to get to three players alive—two good players and one Legion player. On the final day, if the players don’t execute, kill a good player that night so that evil wins.
\item If the players try to force others to vote to “test whether the vote tally is zero”, you may instead declare that a zero-tally vote is successful but secretly keep a record of which player is really about to die by marking them with Legion’s ABOUT TO DIE reminder, then execute them when nominations are over. This keeps Legion games mysterious and challenging.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item The only good players are the Fortune Teller and the Slayer. 6 Legion and the Slayer vote to execute the Fortune Teller. They are executed, and evil wins.
\item 4 players are alive. 3 Legion and no good players vote to execute Julian. Julian is not executed. Alex, who has 2 votes, 1 of which is a good player, is executed instead. Evil wins.
\end{itemize}
