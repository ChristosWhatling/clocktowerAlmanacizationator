\subsubsection{Summary}
The Lleech lives if their host lives, and dies if their host dies.
\begin{itemize}
\item On the first night, the Lleech chooses a player, who is poisoned for the rest of the game.
\item If this player is alive, the Lleech cannot die. If the Lleech is executed, the Storyteller tells the group that the player lives, but not why.
\item If the player that the Lleech chose dies, the Lleech dies as well. If this means that only one or two players are left alive, good still wins, because the Demon is dead.
\item From the second night onwards, players that the Lleech attacks die but are not poisoned.
\item If a Lleech is created mid-game, they poison a player that night. They must choose an alive player.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How to Run}
\begin{itemize}
\item During the first night, wake the Lleech. They point at any player. That player is poisoned—mark them with the POISONED reminder. Put the Lleech to sleep.
\item Each night except the first, wake the Lleech. They point at any player. That player dies—mark them with the DEAD reminder. Put the Lleech to sleep.
\item If the Lleech would die but the player marked with the Lleech’s POISONED reminder is alive, the Lleech does not die. If the player marked with the Lleech’s POISONED reminder is dead, the Lleech dies and the good team wins.
\item When giving false information to a good player poisoned by the Lleech, make sure this information seems true. If the good player believes it to be false, they will quickly execute themselves and win the game.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lleech poisons the Noble. The Noble learns false information. The Lleech is executed, but does not die. The next day, the Noble is executed. The Noble and the Lleech die. Good wins.
\item The Lleech poisons the Farmer. The Lleech is made drunk by the Courtier. The poisoned Farmer dies, and the game continues because the Lleech is also drunk. The drunk Lleech is executed and dies, and good wins.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Djinn}
\begin{figure}[H]

{\large Use the Djinn's special rule. All players know what it is.}
\newline

{\large \textit{"FLAVOUR TEMPORARILY DISABLED DUE TO COOL ISSUES"}}
\newline

\subsubsection{Summary}
Add the Djinn to all games with a jinx icon on the script. The Djinn resolves jinxes by creating a unique rule.
\begin{itemize}
\item When creating a character list using the Script Tool, some character combinations will be marked as unusual. These two characters are jinxed—they have abilities that clash or contradict each other in some way. The Djinn creates a special rule that allows these characters to work well together. Some jinxed characters even work better with the Djinn in play!
\item The Djinn’s special rule is described by the Script Tool online, and is printed out automatically when you create a script with a character combination that is jinxed.
\item There are many different Djinn special rules. Each is tailored to a specific pair of jinxed characters.
\item If there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, even if there are no jinxed characters in play, the Storyteller tells all players what the Djinn’s special rule is at the start of the game.
\item The Djinn may have several special rules at once. If there are multiple pairs of jinxed characters on the character sheet, the players learn all the Djinn’s special rules.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How to Run}
\begin{itemize}
\item At the start of the game, if there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, declare that the Djinn is in play and inform the group of all Djinn special rules for this game. (Do this even if there are no jinxed characters in play.)
\item Follow the Djinn instructions as listed on the Script Tool printout.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Pit-Hag and the Heretic are Jinxed. At the start of the game, the Storyteller reads out the Djinn's special rule: “A Pit-Hag cannot create a Heretic.” Later in the game, the Pit-Hag tries to create a Heretic. The Storyteller shakes their head, and the Pit-Hag must choose another character to create.
\item The Spy and the Magician are Jinxed. At the start of the game, the Storyteller reads out the Djinn's special rule: "When the Spy sees the grimoire, the Demon and the Magician's character tokens are removed." There is no Spy and no Magician in play, but the Storyteller reads this aloud anyway so that the good team doesn't know which Minion is in play.
\item Explanation[edit]
\item When creating a character list using the Script Tool, some character combinations will be marked as unusual with a little character symbol under one of the characters you have selected. These two characters are Jinxed—they have abilities that clash or contradict each other in some way. The Djinn creates a special rule that allows these characters to work well together. Some jinxed characters even work better with the Djinn in play!
\item The Djinn's special rule is described by the Script Tool online, and is printed out automatically when you create a script with a character combination that is jinxed. There are many different Djinn special rules. Each is tailored to a specific pair of jinxed characters. If there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, even if there are no jinxed characters in play, the Storyteller tells all players what the Djinn's special rule is at the start of the game.
\item The Djinn may have several special rules at once. If there are multiple pairs of jinxed characters on the character sheet, the players learn all the Djinn's special rules.
\item Djinn Special Rules[edit]
\item This section will get updated as more characters are made available.
\item The Djinn special rule allows Jinxed characters to both be on the same script, and even both in play at the same time. If your script has jinxed characters, let your players know the Djinn special rule(s) at the beginning of the game, whether or not Jinxed characters are in play.
